Collection of G Suite scripts

## Lottery
This script can be used to take in responses (Name, Email, Other Data) via a Google form and then you can select one or more winners at random via the script. To use this script:  
1. Make a copy of the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W7FxLDAA7oGXp94YedTeshZkj7fThHBwARIe4CQ4JtQ/copy) here.  
2. Click on Tools --> Script Editor and paste the code that you see in `lottery.as`.
3. Save the script

This will add a menu to the Sheet named **Lottery**, in which you will see two options: *Select Random Winners* and *Reset*. Use *Reset* to clear the winners. Once the entries have come in for the Name and Email, you can then select the number of winners you want in the **Total # to select** and then click on *Select Random Winners*.
